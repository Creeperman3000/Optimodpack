As I embarked on the journey of creating a Minecraft modpack, I quickly realized that it wouldn't be a simple task. Researching and selecting mods demanded careful consideration, and ensuring their compatibility was a puzzle on its own. Debugging and refining took up countless hours. Yet, with determination and hard work, I laid the foundation for a modpack that I hoped would bring enjoyment to players everywhere.
